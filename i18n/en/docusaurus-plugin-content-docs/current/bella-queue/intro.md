## 🔥 Project Overview

**Bella-Queue** is a **high-performance task queue processing engine** specifically designed for AI application
scenarios, committed to providing developers with **more reliable, efficient, and user-friendly** AI task processing
capabilities.

The system adopts modern microservice architecture design, building a comprehensive task scheduling system that supports
both Batch API and Task API processing modes. It not only provides powerful task lifecycle management capabilities but
also supports multiple response modes and intelligent queue strategies, flexibly addressing various business scenarios
from small-scale real-time processing to large-scale batch processing.

Whether for online services requiring high-concurrency real-time responses or offline tasks needing large-scale batch
processing, Bella-Queue provides stable and reliable solutions, making AI application development simpler and more
efficient.

## ✨ Features

### 📋 Batch API

**Batch API is designed for large-scale AI task batch processing**, suitable for scenarios that need to process large
amounts of data but don't require high real-time performance, such as bulk content generation, model evaluation, data
analysis, etc. By packaging multiple requests into batch processing, it can significantly reduce costs and improve
processing efficiency.

- **Full OpenAI Protocol Compatibility**: 100% compatible with OpenAI Batch API standards, seamless migration of
  existing applications
- **Large-Scale Task Processing**: Single Batch API supports up to 50,000 tasks, maximum file size 100MB
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Background processing without blocking user operations, supports 24-hour completion
  window configuration
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time processing progress updates
- **Task Cancellation**: Supports active cancellation of incomplete batch processing tasks, completed partial results
  remain accessible
- **Result Download**: Automatically generates output files and error files upon completion, supports download through
  file-api

### ⚡ Task API

**Task API is designed for single AI task real-time processing**, suitable for scenarios requiring quick response and
real-time interaction, such as online customer service, real-time dialogue, instant content generation, etc. Supports
single task submission and processing, provides multiple response modes, meeting different real-time business
requirements.

- **Multiple Response Modes**:
    - `callback`: Asynchronous callback mode, HTTP callback notification after task completion, suitable for
      long-running tasks
    - `blocking`: Synchronous blocking mode, real-time result return, default timeout 300 seconds, suitable for quick
      response scenarios
    - `streaming`: Streaming response mode, supports SSE real-time streaming response, suitable for scenarios requiring
      real-time feedback

### 🎛️ Queue Management

- **Intelligent Queue Strategies**:
    - `fifo`: First-in-first-out, processes tasks in order of queue entry time, guarantees processing order
    - `round_robin`: Round-robin scheduling, alternately pulls tasks from multiple queues, evenly distributes task load
    - `active_passive`: Active-passive mode, prioritizes pulling tasks from primary queue, pulls from backup queue when
      primary queue is empty
    - `sequential`: Global sequential execution, ensures each queue can only have one task running at a time, avoids concurrent competition

- **Queue Management Capabilities**:
    - **Priority Support**: Supports 0-N level queue priorities, smaller values have higher priority (0 for online, 1+
      for offline)
    - **Dynamic Registration**: Supports dynamic registration of new queues, flexible expansion of business scenarios
