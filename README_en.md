# Bella - Be Everyone's Large Language model Assistant

English | [ä¸­æ–‡](./README.md)

Bella is Beike's internal one-stop intelligent access, AI agent creation, and deployment platform. By providing zero-code solutions, API integration, fine-tuning capabilities, and plugin-based capability expansion, it significantly lowers the development barrier for AI applications, promotes the popularization of AI technology, accelerates the company's intelligent upgrade process, and makes important contributions to advancing AI accessibility within Beike.

Building on this foundation, Bella has accumulated many flexibly reusable basic capabilities. We will gradually open-source all non-business-related capabilities, all of which have been validated in large-scale production environments. We hope to make a small contribution to the popularization of AI across the entire industry.
